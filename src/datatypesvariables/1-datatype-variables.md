## Hello Guys, lets start with some of the core concepts data types and variable 8-)

### DATA TYPES ###

_Data type in any programming language represents the type of data/value a particular variable can hold in it._
In Java, the data types are broadly classified as -
-  Primitive
-  Non-Primitive

###### A. Primitive ######
_Primitive datatype is further classified as_
a. Numeric
  1. Integer
        - `byte`
        - `short`
        - `int`
        - `long`

```java
byte b = 123;
short b = 478;
int b = 36374;
long b = 2737383;
```
  2. Floating Point Number
        - `float`
        - `double`

```java
float f = 4563.89F;
double d = 234.78;
```
b. Non - Numeric
  1. `char`
  ```java
  char c = 'A';
  char x = '&';
  ```
  2. `boolean`
  ```java
  boolean bool = true;
  boolean b = false;
  ```

###### B. Non-Primitive ######
1. `Arrays`
2. `String`
3. `System` and so on..

_Almost, all the objects in java can be considered under Non - Primitive data types_

### VARIABLES ###

_`VARIABLE` (In layman's term)- is a container or placeholder that is used for storing data or value which is used by the functions or methods_

In technical term, `variable` is nothing but a memory location within computer internal memory which is used for storing data or value which is used by the functions or methods
